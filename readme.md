#mojedit

A sort-of WYSIWYG editor with a few differences:

 - Seperates block and text-level elements
 - Drag and drop block elements around
 - Doesn't use execCommand, so you can use arbitrary HTML when formatting text

It's implemented as a jQuery plugin and uses Tim Down's excellent [Rangy](http://code.google.com/p/rangy/).

At this stage it's more a proof of concept, it would probably take some work to use in production.

There's no documentation yet. See examples and source. SORRY.
